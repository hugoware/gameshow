# Life Before CSS

CSS hasn't always been the way to define the visual style for a website.


#///

# Formatting With Tags

Before CSS, HTML was styles using a variety of inline elements.

[code:html]
  <p>
    <font face="ariel" color="red" size="3" >
      Howdy!
    </font>
  </p>
[/code]

# Text Formatting

Some elements had specific formatting purposes

[code:html]
<b>This would be bold</b>
<u>And this is underlined</u>
<i>or use this for italic</i>
[/code]



#///

# The Problem...

Often times, pages would be copy/pasted from place to place, bringing all of their errors along with them.

[code:html]
<!-- font name is wrong -->
<font face="ariel" color="red" size="3" >
  ...
</font>
[/code]

# ... And This...

We all did it at one point or another... We should be ashamed...
