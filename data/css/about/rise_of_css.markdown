# The Beginnings

CSS has been around for a very long time, but it wasn't always the preferred way to define the visual design for a site

# Stylesheets

The idea for a means to provide rules for visual design isn't new. `SGML`, Standard Generalized Markup Language, has been around since 1980.

It wasn't until 1996 that the CSS1 first recommendation was published -- **That's 18 years ago!**

# Browser Support

Also in 1996, [Internet Explorer 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#Difficulty_with_adoption) was the first browser to provide partial support for CSS1.

Several years later, Internet Explorer 5 (for Mac) became the first browser to provide more than *99% support* for CSS1

# CSS By Example

Sites like [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) helped show what CSS was able to do by simply changing a stylesheet.
