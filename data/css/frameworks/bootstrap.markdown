# Using Bootstrap

Twitter Bootstrap defines many selectors for a variety of `class` names. By using combinations of `class` names you can theme your entire app without digging into any CSS.

[code:html]
<button type="btn" >default</button>
<button type="btn btn-success" >.btn-success</button>
<button type="btn btn-info" >.btn-info</button>
<button type="btn btn-warning" >.btn-warning</button>
[/code]
