# Using CSS

CSS was designed to keep `markup` and `presentation` code separate from each other.

1. Use a `selector` to choose the element to modify
1. Apply `properties` to the selected element



#///


# A Simple Example

This selector will find all `h1` elements and change their text `color` to *red*.

[code:css]
h1 {
  color: #f00
}
[/code]



#///

# Mutliple Rules

You can apply multiple declarations within a single `block`.

[code:css]
h1 {
  color: #f00;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 32px;
}
[/code]
